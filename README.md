# ðŸš¦ Smart Traffic Control System using YOLOv5

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project
This project implements an **AI-powered Smart Traffic Light System** using **YOLOv5** for real-time vehicle detection.  
Unlike traditional traffic lights that work on **fixed timers**, this system is *adaptive* â€” it dynamically adjusts the green light duration based on the **number of vehicles waiting** in each lane.  

The project simulates how **intelligent traffic management** can reduce congestion and improve road efficiency.

## ðŸ“– Description
- Input: A traffic video of an intersection.  
- Processing:  
  - Detect vehicles using YOLOv5.  
  - Count vehicles in **North-South (NS)** and **East-West (EW)** lanes.  
  - Adjust **green light duration dynamically** depending on vehicle density.  
  - Traffic signal changes follow a **state machine** (Green â†’ Yellow â†’ All-Red â†’ Switch).  
- Output: A new video showing:  
  - Bounding boxes around vehicles.  
  - Regions of Interest (ROIs) for each lane.  
  - Traffic lights (with timers).  
  - Vehicle counts and dynamic green times.

## âœ¨ Features
- âœ… Real-time **vehicle detection** using YOLOv5.  
- âœ… Adaptive green light duration (more cars = longer green).  
- âœ… **State machine logic** ensures realistic light switching.  
- âœ… Safety with **yellow and all-red phases**.  
- âœ… Output video with visual overlays (signals, timers, counts).
